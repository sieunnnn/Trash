#   Sal's Shippers options
#   Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
#   Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you arenâ€™t charged for weight.
#   Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
